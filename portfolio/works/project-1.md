# Conwed - An identity crisis

Conwed was acquired by the Reset Group from Owen's Corning in 2018. Conwed had a lackluster reputation in the acoustics industry, and a complete rebrand was required.

Process

  
Conwed is a corporation with a rich history, dating back to 1921, and specializing in acoustic treatments and services to commercial properties like offices, and concert halls. Although Conwed was already established and known on the local market, the company had a bad reputation and strived for refreshing the visual identity and bringing their products to the next level. 

I led a team of talented graphic designers, and we had a real opportunity to create a brand identity from scratch. The tarnished reputation made the challenge even more interesting, as the companies providing similar services had different approaches and vision of their brand images and needed new original looks. There is always the place for creative perspective in design, and being in the architectural / interior design space, made this project that much more cool. 

For this project, we accomplished a set of tasks according to the stakeholdersâ€™s marketing strategy:

Logo 

Website

Sales and marketing collateral 

Direct Mail

Packaging

### Tools

Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, WordPress, HTML, CSS, Javascript
