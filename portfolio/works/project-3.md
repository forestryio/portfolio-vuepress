# Simplifying Sales

Like Apple, Trek had humble beginnings. The first Trek bike was manufactured by five employees in a rented red barn in Waterloo, a small town in Wisconsin.

Often, Trek dealers and the sales staff are busy, and to streamline the sales process, Trek decided to streamline the sales experience by implementing touch-screen pre-sales qualifiers to prospective buyings so they could be fit with a bike based on height, weight, gender and general use whether leisurely commuting or adventurous trailblazing.
